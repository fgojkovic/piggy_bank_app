# piggy_bank_app

 - Piggy bank app is used to track your "real life" piggy bank. 
 - When you put any amount of money in your bank update it in your app and you will have constant track of your money. 
 - You can have multiple currencies. 
 - Plan your savings. 
 - Use multiple banks.
 
 As of june the 5th application is still not developed as i would like. If I find more time would like to complete it.
 
  - Application was using currency api call from https://api.ratesapi.io/ which doesn't work any more.
